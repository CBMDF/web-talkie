## Design Points

A combo of two npm projects, the backend server and the frontend UI. So there are two `package.json` configs and thereforce [two places to run `npm` commands](#user-content-local-development):

  1. [**Node server**](server/): [`./package.json`](package.json)
  2. [**React UI**](react-ui/): [`react-ui/package.json`](react-ui/package.json)
      * generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
      * deployed via `build` script in the Node server's [`./package.json`](package.json)
      * module cache configured by `cacheDirectories`

## Local Development

Because this app is made of two npm projects, there are two places to run `npm` commands:

1. **Node API server** at the root `./`
1. **React UI** in `react-ui/` directory.

### Run the API server

In a terminal:

```bash
# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

#### Install new npm packages for Node

```bash
npm install package-name --save
```


### Run the React UI

The React app is configured to proxy backend requests to the local Node server. (See [`"proxy"` config](react-ui/package.json))

In a separate terminal from the API server, start the UI:

```bash
# Always change directory, first
cd react-ui/

# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

#### Install new npm packages for React UI

```bash
# Always change directory, first
cd react-ui/

npm install package-name --save
```
